    This git repository was originally made for my trip to BSides 2016. But after a while, i decided to keep on it. It
    is now a place for all of my code, mainly python, that involves security and other cyber related things. Of course,
    please contribute to the community branch so that I and others can learn (be sure to comment :>)
