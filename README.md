# PythonHacking
A repository for my python files used for network infiltration, decryption, and other hacking techniques/diciplines. This is mainly for my trip to BSides Washington DC 2016 (I have gone since ~2010). This will constantly be updated as I, like many others, am still learning. Please dont be a Script Kiddie (wanna be hacker)! Learn the tools and how it is done. 

I am not responsible for what happens if you use any of the files in this repository. Use at your own risk, and use them responsibly.
