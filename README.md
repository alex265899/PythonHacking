# PythonHacking
A repository for my python files used for network infiltration, decryption, and other hacking techniques/diciplines. This is mainly for my trip to BSides Washington DC 2016 (I have gone since ~2010). This will constantly be updated as I, like many others, am still learning, but at the same time I do have school. I am very open to learning! Please, if you know something and are willing to share it, please place it in the community branch, along with an explanation of what the file does and how it works. I really want to learn as much as I can from the community

Please dont be a Script Kiddie (wanna be hacker)! Learn to code your own tools before using outside tools, so that you can learn how they work!

I am not responsible for what happens if you use any of the files in this repository. Use at your own risk, and use them responsibly.
Not at all. This is just a test really. Nothing too serious.
